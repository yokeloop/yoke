# Telegram notifications

Two-layer notification system: skills write JSON to a queue; a stop hook sends the accumulated messages to Telegram.
Notifications are opt-in — without the env vars, the system silently skips sending.

---

## Setup

### 1. Create a bot

- Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) in Telegram
- Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
- Save the resulting token (format `123456789:ABC...`)

### 2. Get the chat_id

- Send any message to your bot
- Call the API:
  ```bash
  curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates" | jq '.result[0].message.chat.id'
  ```
- Save the resulting `chat_id`

### 3. Set environment variables

Add to `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
export CC_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
export CC_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="YOUR_CHAT_ID"
```

Then reload the shell: `source ~/.zshrc`

The variables are forwarded to the hook via `allowedEnvVars` in `hooks/hooks.json`.

## Notification types

| Type            | Marker | When it fires                                   |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ACTION_REQUIRED | ⏸      | Before questions that require an answer         |
| STAGE_COMPLETE  | ✅     | Task, plan, PR, or other artifact is ready      |
| ALERT           | ⚠️     | Block, scope guard, critical situation          |

All three types are always on.

## Notification point map

| Skill | Phase      | Type            | Description                   |
| ----- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| task  | Synthesize | ACTION_REQUIRED | Clarifying questions          |
| task  | Complete   | STAGE_COMPLETE  | Task file ready               |
| plan  | Design     | ACTION_REQUIRED | Implementation questions      |
| plan  | Complete   | STAGE_COMPLETE  | Plan ready                    |
| do    | Execute    | ALERT           | Task blocked                  |
| do    | Complete   | STAGE_COMPLETE  | Implementation complete       |
| fix   | Decide     | ALERT           | Large fix (scope guard)       |
| fix   | Decide     | ACTION_REQUIRED | Clarification required        |
| fix   | Complete   | STAGE_COMPLETE  | Fix complete                  |
| pr    | Decide     | ACTION_REQUIRED | Choose PR type (draft/ready)  |
| pr    | Complete   | STAGE_COMPLETE  | PR created or updated         |

## Testing

Call notify.sh directly and inspect the queue:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/notify.sh \
  --type STAGE_COMPLETE \
  --skill task \
  --phase Complete \
  --slug test \
  --title "Test" \
  --body "test body"
```

Then check the queue file contents:

```bash
cat .sp/notify-pending.json
```

The file should contain a JSON object with a single notification entry. The stop hook (`hooks/notify.sh`) will pick it up when the session ends and send it to Telegram.

---

## Dependencies

- **jq** — for JSON handling (required by both scripts)
- **curl** — for HTTP requests to the Telegram Bot API (required by the stop hook)

If jq or curl is missing, the scripts exit 0.

| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Notifications don't arrive        | Verify `CC_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `CC_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are set: `echo $CC_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`                                                                        |

| 401 from Telegram                 | Bad bot token — recreate it via @BotFather                                                                                                                            |
| 400 (chat not found)              | Bad chat_id — message the bot and rerun getUpdates                                                                                                                    |
| Queue isn't draining              | Confirm `hooks/notify.sh` is registered as a stop hook in `hooks/hooks.json`                                                                                          |
| Telegram unreachable / timeout    | curl waits up to 8 seconds (hook timeout 10s). On failure `notify-pending.json` is removed; no retry. Delete manually: `rm .sp/notify-pending.json`                  |
